# JUMIA WEB SCRAPING PROJECT

This project involves web scraping data from the Jumia website to collect information on Samsung and iPhone phones. The scraped data was then loaded into Excel for further analysis. The project also includes data cleaning and visualization using Tableau.

## DATA COLLECTION

The web scraping process involved extracting information on Samsung and iPhone phones from the Jumia website. This included details such as product names, prices, and other specifications. The data was collected using a web scraping script and saved in Excel format for further analysis.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

After collecting the data, I was able to perform various analyses to gain insights into the Samsung and iPhone phone products available on Jumia. The data was cleaned and processed to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### The following visualizations were created using Tableau:
1. Top 10 Expensive iPhone Products in Ksh: This visualization displays the top 10 most expensive iPhone products available on Jumia, sorted by price in Kenyan Shillings (Ksh).
2. Top 10 Expensive Samsung Products in Ksh: This visualization showcases the top 10 most expensive Samsung products available on Jumia, sorted by price in Kenyan Shillings (Ksh).
3. Most Expensive Samsung Product in Ksh: This visualization highlights the single most expensive Samsung product available on Jumia, displaying its price in Kenyan Shillings (Ksh).
4. Most Expensive iPhone Products in Ksh: This visualization highlights the single most expensive iPhone product available on Jumia, displaying its price in Kenyan Shillings (Ksh).
5. Cheapest iPhone Products in Ksh: This visualization showcases the cheapest iPhone products available on Jumia, sorted by price in Kenyan Shillings (Ksh).
